# RoyalWilanow_App
An unofficial application that generates a monthy summary of the visitor regirster for the Royal Wilanów building based on records prepered in Excel by receptionists

# Python version:
3.13.7

# Description
While working as a receptionist, I decided to create an application that would help my coordinator prepare a monthly summary of the visitor based on Excel files previously compiled by other employees.

# Important:
- This desktop application is unofficial and HAS NOT BEEN inplemented in practice.
- The app works best with the dedicated excel file 'Rejestr_Template'. After adding data to the appropriate tab, you must update the file name by adding a letter that is coresponding to the relevant reception (you can also add date to distinguish files- algoritm will ignore it). To minimalize errors when entering company names, there is a drop-down list that contains every company in the given reception.
